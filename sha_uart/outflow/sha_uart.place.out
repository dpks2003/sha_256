WARNING(1): Clock driver jtag_inst1_TCK should use the dedicated clock pad.
WARNING(2): Clock input pad, clk, of net, clk, drives both clock buffer and logic. Expect extra clock skew.
The driver, jtag_inst1_RESET, of control net, jtag_inst1_RESET, should be placed at a dedicated control pad location.
